# Leaderboard App â€“ Developer Documentation

## Overview

This repository contains a full-stack application structured as a monorepo with two main folders:
- `frontend/`: Vue 3 + TypeScript application using Vite
- `backend/`: Laravel 12 API-only server

---

## Folder Structure

```
/leaderboard-app
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/       # Vite + Vue 3 + Pinia + Element Plus + UnoCSS
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/        # Laravel 12 API-only
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json    # Root npm scripts (scheduler, backend serve)
```

The frontend and backend run independently, allowing full CORS separation and clean architecture.

---

## Running the Project Locally

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- PHP 8.2+
- MySQL 8+
- Composer

### Terminal Tabs Setup (Recommended)

| Terminal | Command |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | `npm run backend` â†’ Laravel dev server |
| 2 | `php artisan queue:work` (run from `/backend`) |
| 3 | `npm run scheduler` â†’ Runs Laravel schedule every minute |
| 4 | `cd frontend && npm run dev` â†’ Vite dev server |

---

## NPM Scripts

Defined in the root `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "backend": "php backend/artisan serve --host=localhost --port=5000",
    "scheduler": "php backend/scheduler.php"
  }
}
```

> `scheduler.php` is a PHP-based script that simulates a CRON scheduler in dev.

---

## Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate --seed
```

> Optionally, run `php artisan players:reset-scores` to clear scores or test manually.

---

## Environment Variables

### `backend/.env`
```dotenv
APP_URL=http://localhost:5000
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
DB_DATABASE=leaderboard_app_db
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### `frontend/public/env.js`
Used to make API URL globally available at runtime:
```js
class DM_Environment {
  constructor() {
    this.API_URL = 'http://localhost:5000'
  }
}
window.DM_ENV = new DM_Environment()
```

---

## Frontend Tooling & Configuration

### Vite Plugins

| Plugin | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| `vite-plugin-pages` | File-based routing |
| `vite-plugin-vue-layouts-next` | Dynamic layouts |
| `unplugin-auto-import` | Auto-imports Vue APIs |
| `unplugin-vue-components` | Auto-imports Element Plus |
| `@unocss/preset-wind3` | Tailwind-compatible UnoCSS |
| `vite-plugin-vue-devtools` | DevTools integration |
| `@vueuse/head` | Metadata control |
| `vue-i18n` | i18n support |

---

## Forms, Validation & Toasts

- Form logic via `el-form` + validation rules
- Toasts via `vue-toastification`
- ZIP code input uses API (`zippopotam.us/CA`) to autofill city and province based on first 3 characters
- Postal code formatting is done with formatter/parser

---

## Backend Functionality

### Players CRUD
- Uses model binding with hash
- Validates address on create, but allows partial update for score

### QR Code Generation
- Address is formatted via a formatter class
- QR code is stored in `/storage/app/public/qrcodes`

### Scheduled Winner Job
- Runs every 5 minutes
- Stores winner only if there's a **unique** highest scorer
- Stored in `winners` table with timestamp and score snapshot

### Score Reset
- `php artisan players:reset-scores` sets all scores to 0

---

## Important Artisan Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `php artisan players:reset-scores` | Resets all scores |
| `php artisan declare:winner` | Declares a new winner if only one top scorer exists |
| `php artisan queue:work` | Runs queued jobs (e.g., QR code generation) |

---

## Production Notes

> **Important decisions intentionally skipped due to interview scope:**

- No pagination or backend-filtering for players (would be necessary for large datasets)
- No Docker setup, but project supports it easily
- No automatic CI/CD pipelines

---

## Testing

```bash
php artisan test   # Laravel feature & unit tests
```

Tests include:
- Player creation
- Player update
- Address validation
- Score reset
- Winner job edge cases

---

## ðŸ“Œ Final Notes

- Project is intentionally clean and scoped to simulate real-world structure
- Vue 3 + Laravel 12 integration follows best practices
- API is RESTful and consistent with naming, status codes, and payloads
